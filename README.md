SilexExtensions
===============

This repository regroups a _large_ set of third-party [Silex Service Providers](http://silex-project.org/doc/providers.html), codename ``Extensions``.
It can also be used as a skeleton to build new self-contained phar service providers.


Available extensions
--------------------

* [DoctrineServiceProvider](http://readthedocs.org/projects/silex-doctrine-extensions/), a set of services that provide Doctrine2 DBAL and ORM functionalities
* DoctrineMongoDBServiceProvider, a set of services that provide Doctrine2 MongoDB ODM functionality

* That's all for the moment

_huge set, isn't it ?_
